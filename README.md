# Overview

This project comes from the Alchemy University - Blockchain Developer bootcamp. It has to be done at the end of the week 3.

# Ethereum Block Explorer

The lessons this week covered the Ethereum JSON-RPC API and the `ethers.js` library giving us the ability to query the Ethereum blockchain and make transactions!

Let's put that knowledge to the test by building our very own **Ethereum Block Explorer**!

Blockexplorers give us the ability to view lots of different information about the blockchain including data about:

- the blockchain network itself
- blocks in the blockchain
- transactions in a block
- accounts
- and many other things

[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is a good example of an Ethereum blockexplorer. Check it out to get familiar with how blockexplorers generally work.

This particular project is very much open-ended. We'll add some challenges here to get your imagination going, but use Etherscan as a guide for features you might consider building in your project.

# Description

Front-end done with React and ChakraUI.
This really basic explorer displays the list of the 10 latest blocks.
When a block number is clicked, the block details and the list of transactions are updated.
When a transaction hash is clicked, the transaction details are displayed.
